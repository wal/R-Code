```

## Part 1
https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/07/01/hacking-statistics-exercises-part-1/


### Excrcise 1 : Use rnorm() to generate 100 points, then plot those points in an histogram.
```{r}
set.seed(42)
data <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(data)
```

### Exercise 2: Repeat exercise 1, but this time with, 500, 1000 and 10000 points.

```{r}
set.seed(42)

data <- rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(data)

data <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(data)

data <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(data)


```

## Exercise 3 - use dnorm() to plot the density 
```{r}
data <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 1)

x <- seq(-4, 4, 0.01)

hist(data, prob=TRUE)
curve(dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1),add=TRUE)
```
